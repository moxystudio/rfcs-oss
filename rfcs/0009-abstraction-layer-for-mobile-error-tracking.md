# Summary

The feature is an abstraction layer to work with different mobile error tracking solutions. The idea here is to have a common API that will be mapped to the particular API of the chosen error tracking solution.

# Basic example

Capturing an error:

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
import createErrorTracking from "@moxy/react-native-sentry";

const errorTracking = createErrorTracking(Sentry, { enabled: true });

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  errorTracking.captureError(err);
}
```

# Motivation

Let's suppose we were using [Sentry](https://sentry.io) as our solution. So, we would be able to capture an error using Sentry's `captureException` method.

```js
try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```

However we might decide to use another error tracking solution later, e.g. [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics). By doing so we would need to go through all our codebase and change all Sentry's methods to their Crashlytics' counterparts, which would becumbersome and time consuming work.

```js
try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  crashlytics().recordError(err);
}
```

What we would like to to instead is mapping our own API to the one from our current error tracking solution. Basically we would only need to import another module.

Another important motivation is to add the ability to toggle the error reporting whenever we want to. Unfortunately, some solutions don't have this feature built-in, so we will create a way to handle this inside the abstraction layer.

# Detailed design

## Implementation for Sentry

```js
const createErrorTracking = (sentry, { enabled = false } = {}) => {
  let isTrackingEnabled = enabled;

  const createTrackingFn = (fn) => (...args) => {
    if (!isTrackingEnabled) {
      return Promise.resolve();
    }

    return fn(...args);
  };

  const captureError = (error) => sentry.captureException(error);

  // level should be: fatal, error, warning, info, or debug.
  const addBreadcrumb = ({ scope, message, level = "info" }) =>
    sentry.addBreadcrumb({
      category: scope,
      message,
      level,
    });

  const setUserId = (level) =>
    sentry.configureScope((scope) => scope.setLevel(level));

  // You can set the severity of an event to one of five values: fatal, error, warning, info, and debug. error is the default, fatal is the most severe, and debug is the least severe.

  const setLevel = (id) =>
    sentry.configureScope((scope) => scope.setUser({ id }));

  const enable = (enabled) => {
    isTrackingEnabled = enabled;

    return Promise.resolve()
  };

  return {
    captureError: createTrackingFn(captureError),
    addBreadcrumb: createTrackingFn(addBreadcrumb),
    setUserId: createTrackingFn(setUserId),
    setLevel: createTrackingFn(setLevel),
    enable,
  };
};

export default createErrorTracking;
```

## Implementation for Firebase Crashlytics

```js
const createErrorTracking = (crashlytics, { enabled = false } = {}) => {
  const enable = (enabled) => {
    crashlytics.setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(enabled);
  };

  await enable(enabled);

  const captureError = crashlytics.recordError;

  const setUserId = crashlytics.setUserId;

  const setLevel = (level) => crashlytics.setAttributes({ level });

  // level should be: fatal, error, warning, info, or debug.
  const addBreadcrumb = ({ scope, message, level = "info" }) =>
    crashlytics.setAttributes({ category: scope, message, level });

  return {
    captureError,
    addBreadcrumb,
    setLevel,
    setUserId,
    enable,
  };
};

export default createErrorTracking;
```

## Setup

```js
// src/shared/react-error-tracking.js

import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

const ErrorTrackingContext = createContext();

export const ErrorTrackingProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ErrorTrackingContext.Provider>{children}</ErrorTrackingContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useErrorTracking = () => {
  const context = useContext(ErrorTrackingContext);

  if (!context) {
    throw new Error(
      "useErrorTracking should be used within an ErrorTrackingProvider"
    );
  }

  return context;
};
```

```js
// src/app/App.js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
import createErrorTracking from "@moxy/react-native-sentry";
import { ErrorTrackingProvider } from "../../shared/react-error-tracking";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: // Sentry's DSN,
});

const errorTracking = createErrorTracking(Sentry, { enabled: true });

const App = () => (
  <ErrorTrackingProvider value={errorTracking}>
    {/* ... */}
  </ErrorTrackingProvider>
);
```

## Usage examples

Suppose there is a `Button.js` component:

```js
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from "react-native";
import { useErrorTracking } from "../react-error-tracking";

const aFunctionThatMightFail = () => {
  throw new Error("Failed");
};

const Button = () => {
  const errorTracking = useErrorTracking();

  const onPress = useCallback(() => {
    try {
      aFunctionThatMightFail();
    } catch (err) {
      errorTracking.captureError(err);
    }
  }, [aFunctionThatMightFail, errorTracking]);

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress}>
      <Text>Press Here</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};
```

Note that it's possible to enable or disable the error tracking as you wish, so it would be possible to:

```js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { View, TouchableOpacity, Text } from "react-native";
import { useErrorTracking } from "../react-error-tracking";

const ToggleErrorTracking = () => {
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(true);

  const errorTracking = useErrorTracking();

  const onPress = useCallback(() => {
    setEnabled((prevState) => !prevState);

    errorTracking.enable(enabled);
  }, [setEnabled, errorTracking]);

  return (
    <View>
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress}>
        <Text>Toggle Error Tracking</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <Text>Error tracking is {enabled ? "enabled" : "disabled"}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## SDK initialization

In my opinion the initialization should not be abstracted, since Sentry and Firebase Crashlytics have quite differente ways of being initialized.

### Sentry

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
    dsn: // Sentry's DSN,
});
```

### Firebase Crashlytics

```js
import crashlytics from "@react-native-firebase/crashlytics";

// you can already use it inside the file
```

# Drawbacks

The only drawback I can see is the initial effort to design the solution, since the maintenance should be really simple.

# Alternatives

The alternative would be using the API provided directly from the error tracking solutions. However, this is not a good idea as I've already commented about in the "Motivation" section.

# Adoption strategy

New and existing apps are required to install the SDK of the chosen error tracking solution and the respective module which implements the abstraction for such SDK:

```sh
npm i @sentry/react-native @moxy/react-native-{solution}

# yarn add @sentry/react-native @moxy/react-native-{solution}
```

where `solution` would be the name of the solution to use, such as `crashlytics` or `sentry`.
Existing apps would also have to be refactored to start using the API specified here.
