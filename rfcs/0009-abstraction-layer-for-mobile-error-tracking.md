# Summary

The feature is an abstraction layer to work with different mobile error tracking solutions. The idea here is to have a common API that will be mapped to the particular API of the chosen error tracking solution.

# Basic example

Capturing an error:

```js
import createErrorTracking from "@moxy/react-native-sentry";

const errorTracking = createErrorTracking({ enabled: true });

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  errorTracking.captureError(err);
}
```

# Motivation

Let's suppose we were using [Sentry](https://sentry.io) as our solution. So, we would be able to capture an error using Sentry's `captureException` method.

```js
try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```

However we might decide to use another error tracking solution later, e.g. [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics). By doing so we would need to go through all our codebase and change all Sentry's methods to their Crashlytics' counterparts, which would be an unnecessary work.

```js
try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  crashlytics().recordError(err);
}
```

What we would like to to instead is mapping our own API to the one from our current error tracking solution. Basically we would only need to import another module.

Another important motivation is to add the ability to toggle the error reporting whenever we want to. Unfortunately, some solutions don't have this feature built-in, so we will create a way to handle this inside the abstraction layer.

# Detailed design

Example for Sentry:

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

const captureError = Sentry.captureException;

// level should be: fatal, error, warning, info, or debug.
const addBreadcrumb = ({ scope, message, level = "info" }) =>
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: scope,
    message,
    level,
  });

const setUserId = (level) =>
  Sentry.configureScope((scope) => scope.setLevel(level));

// You can set the severity of an event to one of five values: fatal, error, warning, info, and debug. error is the default, fatal is the most severe, and debug is the least severe.

const setLevel = (id) =>
  Sentry.configureScope((scope) => scope.setUser({ id }));

const enable = (enabled) => {
  isTrackingEnabled = enabled;
};

const createErrorTracking = ({ enabled = false } = {}) => {
  let isTrackingEnabled = enabled;

  const createTrackingFn = (fn) => (...args) => {
    if (!isTrackingEnabled) {
      return Promise.resolve();
    }

    return fn(...args);
  };

  return {
    captureError: createTrackingFn(captureError),
    addBreadcrumb: createTrackingFn(addBreadcrumb),
    setUserId: createTrackingFn(setUserId),
    setLevel: createTrackingFn(setLevel),
    enable,
  };
};

export default createErrorTracking;
```

Example for Firebase Crashlytics:

```js
import crashlytics from "@react-native-firebase/crashlytics";

const captureError = crashlytics().recordError;

const setUserId = crashlytics().setUserId;

const setLevel = (level) => crashlytics().setAttributes({ level });

// level should be: fatal, error, warning, info, or debug.
const addBreadcrumbs = ({ scope, message, level = "info" }) =>
  crashlytics().setAttributes({ category: scope, message, level });

const enable = (enabled) => {
  isTrackingEnabled = enabled;
};

const createErrorTracking = ({ enabled = false } = {}) => {
  let isTrackingEnabled = enabled;

  const createTrackingFn = (fn) => (...args) => {
    if (!isTrackingEnabled) {
      return Promise.resolve();
    }

    return fn(...args);
  };

  return {
    captureError: createTrackingFn(captureError),
    addBreadcrumbs: createTrackingFn(addBreadcrumbs),
    setLevel: createTrackingFn(setLevel),
    setUserId: createTrackingFn(setUserId),
    enable,
  };
};

export default createErrorTracking;
```

## Usage examples

```js
import createErrorTracking from "@moxy/react-native-sentry";

const errorTracking = createErrorTracking({ isEnable: true });

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  errorTracking.captureError(err);
}
```

## Regarding the initialization

In my opinion the initialization should not be abstracted, since Sentry and Firebase Crashlytics have quite differente ways of being initialized.

- Sentry:

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
    dsn: // Sentry's DSN,
});
```

- Firebase Crashlytics:

```js
import crashlytics from "@react-native-firebase/crashlytics";

// you can already use it inside the file
```

# Drawbacks

The only drawback I can see is the initial effort to design the solution, since the maintenance should be really simple.

# Alternatives

The alternative would be using the API provided directly from the error tracking solutions. However, this is not a good idea as I've already commented about in the "Motivation" section.

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, the developers would need to check our own module which is probably going to be called `@moxy/react-native-{solution}`, where `solution` would be the name of the chosen error tracking solution (it could be `sentry` for instance) and see the available methods. I will probably add this to the RNWM documentation, to make its usage as clear as possible.
