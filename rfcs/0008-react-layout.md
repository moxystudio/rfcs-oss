# Summary

Ability to define which layout to use per page.

# Basic example

Setup `<LayoutManager>` in your `App.js` component:

```js
import { LayoutManager } from '@moxy/react-layout';

// Example Next.js App
const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
    <LayoutManager>
        <Component { ...pageProps } />
    </LayoutManager>
);
```

...and then use `withLayout` in your page components, e.g.: in `About.js`:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { withLayout } from '@moxy/react-layout';
import { PrimaryLayout } from '../../shared/components';
import styles from './About.module.css';

const About = () => (
    <div className={ styles.about }>
        <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
);

export default withLayout(<PrimaryLayout variant="light" />)(About);
```

# Motivation

Frontend projects usually have the need to have one or more layouts. Layouts are the "shell" of your app and usually contain navigation elements, such as an header and a footer. In the ideal scenario, each page would be able to say which layout they want to use, including tweaking its properties dynamically, such as `variant="light"`. However, we also want to keep the layout persistent in the React tree, to avoid having to remount it every time a user navigate between pages.

Historically, projects overlook the need of multiple layouts or the ability to change layout props between pages. They start off with a simple layout and only later they handle this need, often with poor and non-scalable solutions.

I propose to create a library, called `@moxy/react-layout`, that solves the need for multi-layouts and changing layout props dynamically in a consistent and reusable way.

# Detailed design

`@moxy/react-layout` is a very simple library that exposes a `<LayoutManager>` component and a `withLayout` to wrap pages.

## &lt;LayoutManager&gt;

A component that selects the layout based on what pages specify. It keeps the layout persistent between page transitions whenever possible (e.g.: when the layout is the same).

Here's the list of props it supports:

### defaultLayout

Type: `ReactElement`

The default layout to be used when a child page doesn't explicitly set one.

```js
// App.js
import { LayoutManager } from '@moxy/react-layout';
import { PrimaryLayout } from '../shared/components';

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
    <LayoutManager defaultLayout={ <PrimaryLayout /> }>
        <Component { ...pageProps } />
    </LayoutManager>
);
```

### children

Type: `ReactElement`

The children to be rendered inside the layout. The page can either be the `children` itself or a descent and should be wrapped with `withLayout` whenever it needs to choose a layout and tweak its props.

### render

Type: `function`

Override the default render behavior. Has the following signature: `({ Layout, layoutProps, layoutKey, pageKey, children }) => <ReactElement>`, where:

- `Layout` is the layout React component that should be rendered
- `layoutProps` is the layout props of the layout React component
- `layoutKey` is a unique string for the layout to be used as `key`
- `pageKey` is a unique string for the page to be used as `key`
- `children`: the `<LayoutManager>`'s children you specified

The default behavior simply renders the layout and its children, like so:

```js
({ Layout, layoutProps, children }) => <Layout { ...layoutProps }>{ children }</Layout>
```

 However, you may provide a custom render to deal with layout and page transitions. Here's an example that uses [`react-transition-group`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) to apply a simple fade transition between layouts and pages:

```js
// App.js
import { LayoutManager } from '@moxy/react-layout';
import { PrimaryLayout } from '../shared/components';
import { TransitionGroup, CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

const renderLayout = ({ Layout, layoutProps, layoutKey, pageKey, children }) => (
    <TransitionGroup>
        <CSSTransition key={ layoutKey } classNames="fade">
            <Layout { ...layoutProps }>
                <TransitionGroup>
                    <CSSTransition key={ pageKey } classNames="fade">
                        { children }
                     </CSSTransition>
                 </TransitionGroup>
             </Layout>
        </CSSTransition>
    </TransitionGroup>
);

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
    <LayoutManager
        defaultLayout={ <PrimaryLayout /> }
        render={ renderLayout }>
        <Component { ...pageProps } />
    </LayoutManager>
);
```

## withLayout(layout)(Page)

Sets up a `Page` component with the ability to select which `layout` to use. Moreover, it injects a `setLayoutProps` prop so that you may dynamically update the layout props.

### layout

Type: `ReactElement` or `function`

The layout to use for the `Page`. Can either be a `ReactElement` or a function that returns it.

The function form is useful when page props affects layout props. It has the following signature: `(ownProps) => <ReactElement>`. Please note that the function only runs once to determine the layout and its initial props.

### Page

Type: `ReactElementType`

The page component to wrap.

### Injected setLayoutProps

Type: `function`

Allows to dynamically change the layout props. Has the following signature: `(updater | stateChange, callback?)`.

The behavior of `setLayoutProps` is exactly the same as `setState` of class components, except that the `updater` has an extra argument in its signature: `(layoutProps, initialLayoutProps) => object`. The extra argument is named `initialLayoutProps` and contains the layout props that were initially specified in the `layout` parameter of `withLayout(layout)(Page)`.

```js
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { withLayout } from '@moxy/react-layout';
import { PrimaryLayout } from '../../shared/components';

import styles from './About.module.css';

const About = ({ setLayoutProps }) => {
    const handleSetToDark = useCallback(() => {
        setLayoutProps({ variant="dark" });
        // ..or setLayoutProps(() => ({ variant="dark" }));
    }, [setLayoutProps]);

    return (
        <div className={ styles.about }>
            <h1>About</h1>
            <button onClick={ handleSetToDark }>Enable dark mode</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default withLayout(<PrimaryLayout variant="light" />)(About);
```

# Drawbacks

N/A.

# Alternatives

I couldn't find any OSS library that was capable of doing what I'm proposing.

I also considered doing this directly in [`next-with-moxy`](https://github.com/moxystudio/next-with-moxy). However, it's valuable to have it in a separate package to make it easier to re-use, even outside Next.js projects.

# Adoption strategy

Add it to our boilerplate, so that new projects start using it. Whenever necessary, `@moxy/react-layout` can be added to older projects as well.

Furthermore, it seems to integrate well with [RFC 0006](https://github.com/moxystudio/rfcs-oss/pull/6) (page transitions).
